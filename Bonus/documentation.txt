Lighttpd is the web server I use for WordPress. (which is a content manager system)
It serves the static files like images, CSS, and HTML.
But Lighttpd itself cannot run PHP code, so it uses FastCGI to pass PHP requests to PHP-FPM, which is the process that actually executes the PHP scripts.
PHP-FPM runs the PHP interpreter efficiently in the background, manages multiple PHP worker processes, and sends the results back to Lighttpd.
MariaDB is the SQL database where WordPress stores all its data — users, posts, settings, everything.
All three are linked: Lighttpd handles the HTTP traffic, PHP-FPM processes the dynamic PHP pages, and MariaDB stores the data.
Together they make the WordPress site load correctly in the browser.”
