This document explains the technical words used in the Born2beRoot guide in simple, beginner‑friendly language.​

1. Virtual Machines and Operating Systems
Virtual machine (VM)
A VM is a fake computer inside your real computer.​
It has its own operating system, files, and programs, but it uses your real machine’s CPU, RAM, and disk.​

Host
The host is your real physical machine (macOS, Windows, Linux) where VirtualBox is installed.​
It gives resources (CPU, RAM, disk, internet) to the virtual machines.​

Guest
The guest is the operating system running inside the VM (for example, Debian in your Born2beRoot VM).​
The guest behaves like a separate computer even though it is running on the host.​

Operating system (OS)
The OS is the main software that controls the computer, manages hardware, and runs programs (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).​
In this project, the OS inside the VM is either Debian or Rocky Linux, which are both Linux systems.​

Linux distribution (distro)
A distribution is a “flavor” of Linux: same Linux core, but with different tools, packages, and philosophy.​
Examples are Debian, Ubuntu, Rocky Linux, Fedora, and they each organize and ship software differently.​

Debian
Debian is a stable, free Linux distribution that focuses on reliability and long‑term support.​
It is widely used for servers and is recommended for learning system administration.​

Rocky Linux
Rocky Linux is a distribution designed to be compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, used a lot in companies.​
It is more “enterprise‑oriented” and is often used when you want a RHEL‑style system without paying for RHEL.​

Package
A package is a bundle of software: files plus metadata that can be installed on the system.​
For Debian, packages usually have .deb extensions and are managed by the package manager.​

Repository (repo)
A repository is an online warehouse of packages where your system downloads software from.​
When you run apt install something, Debian connects to a repo, downloads the package, and installs it.​

2. Security Models: DAC, MAC, AppArmor, SELinux
DAC – Discretionary Access Control
DAC is the normal Linux permissions system where the owner decides who can read, write, or execute a file.​
If an attacker becomes root under pure DAC, they can usually do almost anything they want on the system.​

MAC – Mandatory Access Control
MAC is an extra security layer on top of DAC which sets global rules enforced by the system, not by users.​
Even if a program runs as root, MAC rules can still say “you are not allowed to read this file” or “you cannot connect to this socket”.​

AppArmor
AppArmor is a MAC system used by Debian/Ubuntu that restricts programs using path‑based profiles.​
A profile says what files, directories, and capabilities a program is allowed to use, and blocks everything else.​

SELinux
SELinux is another MAC system (used in Rocky/RHEL) that uses labels/contexts instead of just file paths.​
It is very powerful but more complex to configure, and policies can be stricter and more fine‑grained.​

Profile (AppArmor profile)
A profile is a configuration file that defines what a specific program can do: which paths it can read, write, or execute.​
If a program tries something outside of its profile, AppArmor can block it or log it as a violation.​

Context / Label (SELinux)
In SELinux, files and processes get security labels like httpd_t or user_home_t.​
Policies are written in terms of these labels, telling which labels can access which others.​

Enforcing mode
In enforcing mode, the MAC system actively blocks actions that are not allowed by its rules.​
Forbidden actions do not happen and are usually logged for later inspection.​

Permissive / Complain mode
In permissive or complain mode, the MAC system does not block actions but logs them as violations.​
This is useful to test rules before turning on full enforcement.​

3. Package Management: APT and Aptitude
Package manager
A package manager is the tool that installs, upgrades, and removes software on your system.​
It also downloads dependencies and ensures packages come from trusted repositories.​

APT (Advanced Package Tool)
APT is Debian’s standard command‑line package manager, used with commands like apt update, apt upgrade, apt install.​
It is simpler to use and is what you will mainly use in Born2beRoot.​

Aptitude
Aptitude is a more advanced front‑end for APT with a text user interface.​
It can suggest solutions to dependency problems and track why some packages are installed, but is not strictly required.​

Dependencies
Dependencies are other packages that a program needs to function correctly.​
If you install a browser, it may depend on libraries for graphics, networking, and SSL, which are installed automatically.​

ncurses GUI
An ncurses GUI is a text‑mode interface that runs in the terminal, using characters and colors instead of windows and mouse.​
You navigate it with keyboard arrows, Enter, and sometimes shortcuts, but it still stays inside your terminal window.​

4. Disk, Partitions, LVM, and Encryption
Disk / drive
A disk is a physical or virtual storage device where all data is stored (like an SSD or HDD).​
In VirtualBox, the .vdi file is the virtual disk for your VM.​

Partition
A partition is a slice of a disk that acts like its own mini‑disk.​
You can have multiple partitions on one physical disk to keep data separated.​

Mount point
A mount point is a folder where a partition is attached so it becomes accessible in the filesystem.​
For example, if a partition is mounted at /home, all user home directories live in that partition.​

Traditional partitioning
Traditional partitioning means you divide the disk into fixed partitions from the start and each one has a fixed size.​
Changing sizes later is possible but can be complicated and risky.​

LVM – Logical Volume Manager
LVM is a system that lets you build flexible virtual partitions on top of physical disks.​
It makes it much easier to resize logical volumes or add more storage later without reinstalling everything.​

Physical Volume (PV)
A PV is a real disk or a real partition that LVM uses as raw storage (for example /dev/sda2).​
You turn a normal partition into a PV so it can join an LVM Volume Group.​

Volume Group (VG)
A VG is a pool of storage created from one or more PVs.​
You carve logical volumes out of this pool instead of dealing with the raw disk directly.​

Logical Volume (LV)
An LV is like a virtual partition created inside a Volume Group.​
You then format it and mount it as /, /home, /var, etc., just like a traditional partition.​

Block device
A block device is any device that stores data in fixed‑size blocks (disks, partitions, LVM volumes).​
They appear in /dev/ as names like /dev/sda, /dev/sda1, /dev/mapper/vg-lv_root.​

Swap
Swap is disk space used as emergency extra RAM when the physical RAM is not enough.​
It is slower than RAM but helps prevent programs from crashing when memory is tight.​

LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup)
LUKS is the standard way of doing full disk encryption on Linux.​
It creates an encrypted container that you unlock with a passphrase at boot.​

Encryption
Encryption is the process of scrambling data so it cannot be read without a key or password.​
If someone steals your disk, they only see random data unless they know the passphrase.​

Cipher (AES‑256)
A cipher is the algorithm that transforms plain data into encrypted data.​
AES‑256 is a widely used, very strong encryption cipher with a 256‑bit key.​

5. Common Linux Directories: /, /home, /var, etc.
/ (root directory)
/ is the top of the Linux filesystem; every other path starts from here.​
Think of it as the root of a tree where all folders and files hang from.​

/home
/home contains all user home directories like /home/user1, /home/user2.​
Your personal files, configs, and documents typically go into your home directory.​

/var
/var holds data that changes over time, like logs, mail queues, caches, and spools.​
These files can grow, shrink, and are not constant.​

/var/log
/var/log is where log files live, recording what the system and services have done.​
Logs are critical for debugging issues and for security audits.​

/tmp
/tmp is used for temporary files that programs create while they run.​
This directory is often cleared at reboot, so it is not for permanent storage.​

/srv
/srv is intended to hold data served by the system (for example web content, FTP data, or other service data).​
Not every system uses /srv, but it is a standard place to store server data.​

/boot
/boot contains the kernel and bootloader files needed to start the operating system.​
It is usually left unencrypted so the system can start and then unlock the encrypted volumes.​

6. SSH and Networking Basics
SSH (Secure Shell)
SSH is a secure way to control another machine through a terminal over the network.​
All communication, including passwords and commands, is encrypted so others cannot read it.​

Daemon (for example sshd)
A daemon is a background service that keeps running to provide something (like SSH access).​
sshd is the SSH server daemon that listens for incoming SSH connections.​

Port
A port is like a door number on an IP address.​
SSH usually listens on port 22, but in Born2beRoot it is changed to 4242 for security reasons.​

Listening on a port
A service “listening” on a port means it is waiting for connections on that port.​
For example, sshd listening on port 4242 means it will accept SSH connections sent to that port.​

SSH key pair
An SSH key pair is two files: a public key and a private key.​
The public key goes on the server, and the private key stays on your machine and must remain secret.​

Passphrase (for SSH key)
A passphrase is a password that protects your private key file.​
If someone steals your private key file but does not know the passphrase, they still cannot use it.​

authorized_keys
This is a file on the server listing all public keys that are allowed to log into that user account.​
If your public key is in authorized_keys, you can log in without typing your account password.​

7. Firewalls: UFW and Firewalld
Firewall
A firewall is a filter that controls what network traffic can go in and out of your machine.​
It can block unwanted connections from the internet and allow only specific services.​

UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
UFW is a simple tool to manage firewall rules with easy commands.​
You write commands like ufw allow 4242 instead of complex raw firewall rules.​

Firewalld
Firewalld is another firewall manager that uses the concepts of zones and services.​
It is common on Rocky/RHEL systems instead of UFW.​

iptables
iptables is a low‑level command line tool to configure Linux firewall rules.​
Tools like UFW and Firewalld are higher‑level front‑ends on top of iptables or its newer replacement.​

Deny incoming / allow outgoing
This is a common firewall policy where the machine blocks all new incoming connections but lets your machine initiate connections to the outside.​
It makes it harder for outsiders to reach you while still allowing you to use the internet normally.​

8. Services and systemctl
Service
A service is a long‑running background program that provides a function like SSH, cron, firewall, or web server.​
Services usually start automatically when the system boots and stay running.​

systemctl
systemctl is the main command to manage services on systems that use systemd.​
You can start, stop, restart, enable (start at boot), and check the status of services with it.​

Examples:

systemctl start ssh → start the SSH service now.​

systemctl enable ssh → start SSH automatically at every boot.​

Enable at boot
Enabling a service at boot means the service is automatically started when the machine boots.​
This is important for things like SSH and your firewall, which you need running all the time.​

9. Cron and Monitoring
cron
cron is a scheduler that runs commands or scripts at certain times or intervals (like every 10 minutes).​
It is used to automate tasks such as backups, monitoring, and maintenance.​

crontab
A crontab is the file where scheduled tasks are defined for a user.​
Each line in a crontab describes when a command should run and what command it is.​

Monitoring script
A monitoring script is a script that collects and shows system information such as CPU, RAM, disk usage, and network.​
In Born2beRoot, this script runs every 10 minutes and uses wall to broadcast the information to all logged‑in users.​

10. Useful Commands from the Guide
lsblk
Lists all block devices: disks, partitions, and LVM volumes in a tree view.​
You use it to check your partition and LVM layout.​

pvdisplay, vgdisplay, lvdisplay
These commands show detailed information about Physical Volumes, Volume Groups, and Logical Volumes in LVM.​
They help verify your LVM setup (which volumes exist, their sizes, and where they belong).​

hostname / hostnamectl
hostname shows the current hostname of the machine.​
hostnamectl can show and change the hostname in a more modern way on systemd systems.​

journalctl
Shows system logs collected by systemd’s journal.​
You can use it to inspect sudo logs, service failures, and general system activity.​

wall
Sends a message to all logged‑in users’ terminals.​
It is used by the Born2beRoot monitoring script to broadcast system stats to everyone.​
